# LMG-YOLO

## Introduction
This is an enhanced version of YOLOv11, developed based on the paper "Enhanced YOLOv11 for Button Cell Battery Defect Detection: Leveraging Local Channel Semantic Guidance and Multi-Scale Interaction". It is used for detecting defects in button cell batteries. The model leverages local channel semantic guidance and multi-scale interaction to improve detection performance.
